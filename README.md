AudioMaster is a voice-controlled Android Auto app designed to enhance your in-car audio experience. 
The app utilizes advanced DSP (Digital Signal Processing) to optimize the sound quality based on the car's acoustic environment, the type of music being played, and user preferences. 
It also offers a range of voice-activated controls, allowing drivers to adjust audio settings without taking their hands off the wheel.
